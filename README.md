## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### `npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `npm run eject` - If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
